		Emacs for Amiga-OS.

This directory contains files not really needed to build GNU Emacs on
Amiga-OS.  Because we use ixemul library we can use configure and
Makefile from the UNIX version (with a few patches however).

Don't forget to read the text files.  There is at least one important
configure option: --with-intui.  I have tried to make the Doc rather
short.

* Preliminaries

To compile Emacs, you will need a GNU C compiler (gcc, ...), GNU
binutils (ld, ...), GNU make and various basic UNIX shell commands
(rm, mkdir, cp, install, ...).  Currently you can find that all at
<ftp.ninemoons.com> (Look for GeekGadgets or ADE).

If you want using Emacs on a window system:

For X you need ADE-X, which can be found in the alpha directory of
GeekGadgets project.

For Intuition you need at least graphics.library-39.  That library is
part of Amiga-OS version 3.0 or later versions.

* Building and installing
 See file Doc in this directory

* How to get updates

 I will upload diffs containing updates and fixes to my WWW homepage
<home.in-brb.de/~bertw>.

* Other files in this directory.

 Doc - Short description for invocation, installing, compiling Emacs under AmigaOS
 Hints - Some solutions for problems (I wrote it mainly for myself)
 Todo - Things todo and already done or undone (Warning: My English is terrible)
 examples - A directory with lisp (startup) files.  No sophisticated stuff.
