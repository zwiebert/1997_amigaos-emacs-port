This file is part of the Amiga-IxEmul version of GNU-Emacs-20.2

List of various simple problems + solutions with Emacs on AmigaOS.

Hangs in startup when Miami (TCP/IP) is active:
 * if ixtrace shows it hangs in gethostbyname(), then it may help to add
the name of your host to Miami's host-database like this:

  IP         Name        Aliases
127.0.0.1   localhost  skat.in-brb.de
                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^<=the name of your Amiga

TeX mode and PasTeX:
 * Ixemul-47 does doubling backslashes (\) in commandline for
non-Ixemul programs.  Therefore it's not possible to pass some TeX
commands via commandline to non-Ixemul PasTeX (like on
Meeting-Pearls-III).  A possible workaround is to use a non-Ixemul
command-shell to execute a script which contains the TeX command line.
(See the file "../amigaos/examples/latex")

ComInt mode (used by shell, gud, ...)
 * comint-send-eof closes the input channel for the interpreter
(shell).  (Its sometimes useful to redirect input to "/con").

MultiUser related problems:
 * Patch the string "Home" in "LIBS:multiuser.library" to "HOME".
 * Use "env:HOSTNAME" instead "env:HostName".

No AREXX port:
 * Autodoc.rexx cannot control Emacs anymore but you can use:
     cd /gg/osinclude ; find -name "*.h" | xargs etags
